# MyReads Project

This web based app allows you to store all of your favourite books (from a small selection) in your very own virtual bookshelf!

Your bookshelf has three shelves, one for the books you're currently reading, one for those that you want to read, and the bottom shelf hosts all the books that you have already read.

 [Create react App] #createreactapp

## Instructions

To install this web app, simply run 'npm install' in your terminal to install the project's dependencies, then enter 'npm start' (or 'yarn start' if you have yarn installed on your machine) to run the application.

Once the app is loaded, use the green button to unveil a drop down list of options beside each book. Each option in the menu corresponds to one of the three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. Select the options to move your books between the shelves.

To add new books to your selection, click on the green button with a plus icon, which is located at the bottom right of the screen. This will bring up a search input field, where you can type in whatever subject you are interested in, so long as it meets one of the 20 available search terms, to browse various books on that subject. Just like on the main bookshelf page, there is an identical button and drop down list on every book that you can click on to send books to your bookshelf.


## Contributing 

This is an assessed project for the Udacity Nanodegree programme so I will most likely not be accepting pull requests as that would probably be considered cheating.

## Acknowledgements

Much of the code, in particular the API functions, was put together by the good people at Udacity, making this project possible.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
