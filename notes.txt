set a default value for the list select menu

1:38:00 in study jam
Pass the value of whichShelf down to ListControl as props
And set as the value of each select item
Not quite sure how she did that? Rewatch?



Search Results doesn't make sense? ol inside a div inside an ol? Should put list item outside the component and give a key in the li. Like at 1:55:00





2:09:00 add error handling for searchResutls - searchResults.error, could use .catch?

2:18:00 implementing list control on search page looks really easy.

2:35:00 Set default value of searchResults to none. Then implement a way to make the value match the shelf that it is on in the main page


Completed tasks

Work on the search input
Remove query.trim() as it will stop your user from being able to search for multiple words - CHECK

2:02:00 - maybe update to make sure searchResults are empty if there is no query. Because I think mine will still display the results if you delete? Or is that when it crashes? checked

2:04:00 - books without image thumbnails will make search crash. So just include an if statement in front of them to ensure there is a thumbnail - Just? JUST? Checked, finally works.
